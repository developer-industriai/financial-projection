# Financial Projection Model

This project creates a financial projection model for a new business.
The model is based on parameters that will change the model on real time.

It is more appropriated to a SaaS (Software as a Service) business, but it can be adapted to other types of business, and B2B (Business to Business, when the paying customer is a company).

The tax and labour charges are based on the UK legislation, consider a limited company.
